# Javascript Frameworks

## Description:
This is the first time I have used react so it was a little bit tricky to start with as I had to learn what the difference in way of writing the code was. Overall I focused mostly on the functionality and getting it to work rather than making it look amazing.
I am happy with the end product but there is still some areas I would like to change/ continue working on to get it to all to work better.
